### To Get Static Resources Working with Thymeleaf ###

1. Move static resource to resources/static/* directory.
    * for example: href="/manifest.json" would be in
      /resources/static/manifest.json
    * href="/js/main.js" would be in
      /resources/static/js/main.js
2. Wrap url in index.html (located in /resources/templates/)
    in th:href="@{...}"
    * th:href="@{manifest.json}"
