### To Serve React Front End From Build Directory File ###
1. Create simple front end request handler controller class
    @Controller
    public class HomePageController {

        @GetMapping
        public String index() {
            return "index.html";
        }
    }
2. The above will look in /resources/static/ so copy React
    build directory as static to /resources/ directory.
3. No other modification necessary - React works as normal

### To Prepare React and Server for Build ###
Delete React build, resources static and target directory
before packaging build.
